# Hands-On-Project : Building a Home Lab for Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysis
This project will help you gain practical experience in cybersecurity, focusing on monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents. 

You will set up a home lab that simulates a real-world SOC environment, using tools like SIEM, IDS, and log management.

## Project Overview:

**Environment Setup**: Create a virtual network with multiple VMs to simulate an enterprise environment.

**Log Management and SIEM**: Set up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to collect and analyze logs.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

**Incident Detection and Response**: Simulate cyber attacks and practice incident detection and response.

## Resources and Tools

**ELK Stack Documentation**: Learn how to set up and configure Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

**Snort Documentation**: Understand Snort installation, configuration, and rule creation.

**Cybersecurity Labs**: Platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box offer practical labs for hands-on practice.

**Books**: "The Practice of Network Security Monitoring" by Richard Bejtlich and "Applied Network Security Monitoring" by Chris Sanders and Jason Smith.

By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in setting up and managing a SOC environment, detecting and responding to security incidents, and using essential cybersecurity tools and practices. 


This will prepare you well for a SOC analyst interview.
