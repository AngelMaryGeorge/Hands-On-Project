# Step-by-Step Guide
## 1. Environment Setup
Virtualization Software: Use VirtualBox or VMware to create virtual machines (VMs).

VMs Configuration: Create multiple VMs to simulate different components of an enterprise network (e.g., web server, database server, workstation).

Example Configuration:

Web Server: Running Apache/Nginx.

Database Server: Running MySQL/PostgreSQL.

Workstation: Running Windows/Linux.

## 2. Log Management and SIEM

Install ELK Stack: Set up the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for log management.

Elasticsearch: Stores and indexes log data.

Logstash: Collects, parses, and transforms logs.

Kibana: Visualizes log data in dashboards.

Installation Steps:

```bash
# Elasticsearch
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch

# Logstash
sudo apt-get install logstash
sudo systemctl start logstash
sudo systemctl enable logstash

# Kibana
sudo apt-get install kibana
sudo systemctl start kibana
sudo systemctl enable kibana
```

Configure Logstash: Create configuration files to collect logs from various sources (e.g., system logs, application logs).

Example Logstash Configuration (logstash.conf):

```plaintext

input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/syslog"
    type => "syslog"
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
    index => "syslog-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
```

Kibana Dashboards: Set up dashboards in Kibana to visualize log data and create alerts.

### 3. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Install Snort: Deploy Snort, an open-source network IDS.

Installation Steps:

```bash

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install snort
Configure Snort: Customize Snort rules to detect various types of network threats.
```
Example Rule: Detecting a ping sweep.

```plaintext
alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP Ping Sweep"; itype:8; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
Integration with SIEM: Configure Snort to send alerts to your SIEM system (Logstash).
```

## 4. Incident Detection and Response

**Simulate Cyber Attacks**: Perform simulated attacks on your network to generate security events.

Examples:

**Nmap Scan**: Conduct a network scan using Nmap.

``bash
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
```
**SQL Injection**: Perform an SQL injection attack on a web application.

**Analyze Logs and Alerts**: Use Kibana to analyze logs and identify malicious activity.

**Create Alerts**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities such as multiple failed login attempts, unusual network traffic, etc.

**Incident Response Plan**: Develop and execute an incident response plan based on the detected events.

**Steps**:

Identification: Confirm the security incident.

Containment: Isolate affected systems.

Eradication: Remove the cause of the incident.

Recovery: Restore and validate system functionality.

Lessons Learned: Document the incident and response actions for future improvements.
