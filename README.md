# Hands-On-Project : Building a Home Lab for Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysis
This project will help you gain practical experience in cybersecurity, focusing on monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents. 

You will set up a home lab that simulates a real-world SOC environment, using tools like SIEM, IDS, and log management.

## Project Overview:

Environment Setup: Create a virtual network with multiple VMs to simulate an enterprise environment.

Log Management and SIEM: Set up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to collect and analyze logs.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

Incident Detection and Response: Simulate cyber attacks and practice incident detection and response.
